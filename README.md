# CatWorx BadgeMaker App
I used C# to build a console app that creates employee security badges for a rapidly expanding startup, CatWorx. I used the .NET framework to import libraries that let me read and write to the file system, query APIs, and generate images.

# The Fundementals

- Created a "Hello, World" App
- Explored the Program.cs File
  - Learned about Namespaces and the System namespace
- The Main() method being the entry point fo the application and is invoked when the program runs.

### C# Data Types

## Storing Employee Data
### Learned how to:
- Interact with users via the command-line interface (CLI).
- Declare and call class methods.
- Create and instantiate a new class.
- Refactor the code along the way to keep the project organized, maintainable, and extensible.
### Approach:
1. Prompt the user and store their employee data.
2. Organize the code using methods with single responsibility.
3. Create a class to hold the employee objects.
4. Print the employee information.
